In western Europe, there has been a noticeable decrease in the abundance of this species during the 1990s, which may be due to the widespread use of Ivermectins and similar compounds as systemic helminthicides. These compounds render cow-dung toxic to a range of dung-feeding insects, but their level of toxicity to E.arbustorum remains to be established, so that the extent to which the disappearance of this species is due to the spread of these compounds into general use remains uncertain.","yes","unclear","Bilyana Stoykova"

"Microdon major",1912,"due to confusion with M.analis, the range of this species is at present uncertain. It can be confirmed from France and Germany. Given that the open country Formica rufa group ant species have become much less frequent during the 20th century, because of intensification of farming, it would be expected that M.major is itself becoming a threatened species.","yes","yes","Bilyana Stoykova"
"Microdon mutabilis",1758,"supposedly occurring from Fennoscandia south to Iberia and the Mediterranean; from Ireland east through most of Europe, into European parts of Russia; through Siberia to the Pacific coast. But existing range data for this taxon must now be regarded as unreliable, since they are based almost exclusively on specimens collected as adults that were determined prior to description of M.myrmicae. The only populations of Microdon mutabilis sensu Sch√∂nrogge et al (2002a, b) studied by those authors were from Britain and Ireland. The presence of the species has subsequently been confirmed in Sweden (Bartsch et al, 2009b). Beuker (2004) and Reemer et al (2009) no longer regard M.mutabilis as present in the Netherlands. Bonelli et al (2011) were unable to confirm the presence of M.mutabilis sensu Sch√∂nrogge et al (2002a, b) from anywhere in central Europe, where its known host ant, Formica lemani is largely subalpine, implying that M.mutabilis would be likewise subalpine there. However, it has since been established (Van de Meutter, 2015) that a lowland, dry grassland ant species, F. cunicularia, can act as host for M. mutabilis larvae. By contrast, M.myrmicae occurs in wetlands in the montane zone and at lower altitudes in central Europe. On this basis, the adults of M.mutabilis that can be found in well-drained subalpine grassland in Switzerland presumably belong to M.mutabilis sensu Sch√∂nrogge et al (2002a, b), highlighting the need for better information about the high-altitude populations of M.mutabilis in the Alps.","yes","no","Bilyana Stoykova"
"Microdon myrmicae",2002,"uncertain, due to confusion with M.mutabilis. At present, the presence of this species is confirmed from France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, parts of European Russia (Karelia), Slovakia, Switzerland and the Ukraine. Confirmation of the presence of this species is largely dependent upon availability of determined larval or puparial material, although the habitat in which the adult insect is found can also be diagnostic.","yes","no","Bilyana Stoykova"
"Milesia crabroniformis",1775,"from northern France (Brittany) south to central Spain and round the Mediterranean, including islands, to the former Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey; also in N Africa. There are some records from central Europe (Switzerland). This species is not known from Russia. It is now very localised in parts of its range and apparently retreating at the northern edge of its range, though there are indications that recently it may have become established in Britain, where sightings of the species in SW England in 2006 and 2007 have been announced (Gainey, 2008;Tremewan, 2008).

Threatened at the European level. This is one of the few species of Diptera so far included on any continental European ""Red List"": see Andersson et al (1987). Not only is this species evidently a victim of forest clearance and forest management throughout Western Europe, it is such an unmistakeable insect it is highly unlikely that its presence would go undetected. The fact that it is the only species in its genus (and Tribe) and is endemic to Europe makes its status of greater significance. If ever there were a syrphid which required special protection measures to be taken to ensure its survival in Europe then P.abdominalis is it.

Similarly, the use of the systemic pesticides, the Ivermectins, in cattle, appears to be causing a decrease in the frequency of R.campestris at present, though there is as yet no experimental work on the degree of toxicity of these chemicals to Rhingia larvae - Ivermectins excreted in cow-dung are known to be lethal to dung beetles (Aphodiidae etc.).","yes","unclear","Emil Cyranka"

Although frequent during the 19th century, this species has all-but-disappeared from most parts of Europe during the 20th century and it should probably be regarded as threatened at European level. Its disappearance co-incided with that of the horse from the European countryside, and it is tempting to speculate that R.rostrata was largely dependent on dry horse dung as a larval microhabitat.
