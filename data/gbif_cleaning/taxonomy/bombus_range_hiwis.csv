"Bombus","ruderarius","Europe","Thoracobombus",1776,"The range of Bombus ruderarius extends over a large part of the West-Palaearctic region.
In the Iberian peninsula, it is found in the northern mountain ridges, where the form montanus coexists with the nominal subspecies. The nominal subspecies is present in Ireland, Great-Britain and in Fennoscandia, around the Gulf of Bothnia, where it reaches the Arctic Circle. In Russia, the nominal subspecies and the form montanus are found, grossly, between the 50th and 60th parallels. The eastern limits of the species are in SW. Siberia and in the mountains of E. Turkestan (ssp. sartus). Southwards, the range of B. ruderarius extends to the south of the Italian peninsula and in the Balkan, to the Parnassos Mt. (Greece) without including, however, the Mediterranean littoral and the large Mediterranean islands. The subspecies B. ruderarius tunensis is endemic to E. Algeria and N. Tunisia. The nominal subspecies is found in W. Anatolia, whereas B. ruderarius simulatilis lives in the mountains of Anatolia, the Caucasus region and N. Iran. There appears to be a wide discontinuity between the populations of this region and those of the S. Russia plains.

Ireland but completely absent from Scotland. North, it extends in Fennoscandia to the 63rd parallel and in Russia to the 60th parallel. East, it hardly extends beyond the southern part of the Ural Mts., to Cheliabinsk. South-east, B. sylvarum is present throughout E.

In the southern part of its range, B. sylvarum is clearly a montane species. It reaches the Etna in Sicily and the Taurus and Amanaus in Anatolia.

The species lives in the plains of N. Europe. The most southern confirmed observations are in the south of the French Massif Central, about the 44th parallel.
As some old data concerning locations in Italy are dubious as they refer to isolated and maybe wrongly identified individuals, Bombus veteranus has not been reliably reported south of the Alps and the Carpathians.
West, B. veteranus reaches the coasts of French Brittany but not the British Is., nor the Pyrenees, nor the Iberian peninsula. North, B. veteranus does not extend beyond the 60th parallel, except in Finland where its range appears to be rapidly expanding. In Russia, it extends east to Irkutsk, including the Altai and the Sayan Mts. It is also present in N. Mongolia.
Within this range, the very abundance of the species is highly variable in time and space. In most places, it is uncommon but it may abound in some, without any intelligible ecological reason. To give eamples, it was one of the most abundant bumblebees in Belgium one century ago, but it is now nearly vanished there.
